"We need more evil female characters" yall cant even handle brook.
When you're mean to the numbers, you're being mean to me.
Acari is a strong, independent woman and we love her. Just dont let her near kobolds.
Does anyone else think that Acari's skeletons are kinda hot?
Would.
Wouldn't.

Maybe I shouldn't.
My other ride is a 25ft. snake with Triple-D's
Why are her wings like that?
When tf did she get wings?
Flying snakes is a nightmare for the humble crab.
"Dnd characters always have amnesia" factoid actualy just statistical error. average dnd character knows their backstory entirely. Amnesia Ku, who lives forever & forgets over 10,000 lives each day, is an outlier adn should not have been counted
